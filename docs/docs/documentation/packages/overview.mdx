# Packages

ZCore Packages are a collection of reusable components designed to enhance and extend the functionality of your ZCore applications. Similar to Python packages, ZCore Packages provide a convenient way to modularize and share components across different applications on the ZCore platform. This overview document will guide you through the key concepts and steps involved in working with ZCore Packages.

### Key Concepts

- **Package Structure:**
    ZCore Packages follow a standardized structure that includes directories for components, configurations, and documentation. Understanding this structure is crucial for creating, sharing, and utilizing packages effectively.

- **Component Types:**
ZCore Packages can contain various types of components, such as views, templates, routes, and more. Each component type serves a specific purpose and can be seamlessly integrated into ZCore applications.

- **Package Metadata:**
Every ZCore Package includes metadata that provides essential information about the package, such as its name, version, author, and dependencies. This metadata ensures proper identification and compatibility when integrating the package into an application.
